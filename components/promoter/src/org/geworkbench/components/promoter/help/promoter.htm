<a name="Overview"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Overview">Overview</span></h1>
<p>The <b>Promoter</b> component scans one or more sequence profiles 
against nucleotide sequences that the user has loaded into geWorbench.  
Motifs from the JASPAR database of transcription factor binding sites 
are included with the component.  Additional motifs can be added by the 
user.
</p><p>The <b>Promoter</b> component will also display the results of hits found in the <b>Pattern Discovery</b> component.
</p>
<a name="JASPAR_CORE_database"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="JASPAR_CORE_database">JASPAR CORE database</span></h1>
<p>The promoter component of geWorkbench includes the JASPAR CORE database (Bryne 2008, Sandelin 2004) (<a href="http://jaspar.genereg.net/" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://jaspar.genereg.net/</a>).
  As of the October 2009 release, it contains 459 curated, non-redundant
 profiles.  These "profiles are derived from published collections of 
experimentally defined transcription factor binding sites for 
multi-cellular eukaryotes. The database represents a curated collection 
of target sequences"  (<a href="http://jaspar.genereg.net/html/TEMPLATES/help.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">JASPAR Documentation</a>).
</p><p><br>
The profiles represent counts of how many times each of the four 
nucleotide bases occurs at a particular position in the aligned promoter
 sequences.

the order A, C, G, T.  There are no header lines or row labels, just the
 numeric matrix.  For example, here is a profile showing the first six 
columns:
</p><p>0  12 0  0  1  0

<a name="LOGO_display"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="LOGO_display">LOGO display</span></h3>
<p>The LOGO display implements the method of Schneider and Stephens 
(1990) to display the information at each position in a motif.  Briefly,
 the total height of the column of letters at a position shows the 
information available, on a scale of 0 to 2 bits (the information needed
 to represent the 4 possible nucleotide bases at each position).  The 
relative heights of each letter in a column show their individual 
contribution to the information at that position.
</p><p>The LOGO display in geWorkbench implements the "small sample 
correction" described by Schneider, the magnitude of which depends on 
the number of sequences aligned to generate the profile.  The correction
 is subtracted from the calculated information content at each position,
 with a minimum value (floor) of zero being displayed.
</p>
<a name="Table_display"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Table_display">Table display</span></h3>
<p>A table is used to show the numeric data from which the LOGO diagram 
is generated.  The table depicts each position in the profile as a 
column, and has a row for each of the four nucleotide bases A, C, G and 
T.  The user can choose to display the data either as the original 
counts or as frequencies.
</p>
<a name="Display"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Display">Display</span></h4>

<p>A background sequence is used to estimate an appropriate scoring threshold.  This background can be generated in two ways.
</p>
<ol><li> determine base composition of input sequence and from this generate random sequence.
</li><li> (13K) - use a set of 13,000 promoter sequences as background.
</li></ol>
<ul><li> The length of background sequence scanned is given by 1000*Iterations/PValue.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The threshold value is calculated by scanning the background 
sequence with the profile and finding the top 100 scores.  The 100th 
score is used as the threshold.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Calculated p-values are Bonferroni corrected and also corrected for duplicates in the list of 100 top scores.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Positive and negative strands are scanned and values above threshold are reported.

sequence described above.   If checked, use the 13K sequences as 
background. 
</li><li> Iterations -

representation of the sequence which was searched against.  Clicking on a
 position along the line or character representation will cause that 
portion of the sequence to be displayed in the detail box at the bottom 
of the component.  This box also displays numbers representing position 
along the sequence, relative to the start of that particular sequence 
(not its genomic location).  Both the character and detail views will 
show the location and extent of any profile match to the sequence.
</p><p>If matches are found, the sequence will include blocks in various
 colors (each motif will be represented by a unique color) with solid 
arrows indicating the match orientation (forward or reverse complement).
 Individual hits can be identified by positioning the mouse pointer over
 them, which will display a tool tip. Clicking on an area with a match 
will show it in the Sequence Detail at the bottom with the hits shown as
 boxes around the characters.
</p><p>The tooltip format is as follows: numeric position, Transcription
 Factor name &lt;numeric position of the first character of the pattern,
 numeric position of last matching pattern character&gt;.

<a name="Normalization_and_the_Pseudocount"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Normalization_and_the_Pseudocount">Normalization and the Pseudocount</span></h2>
<p>The count matrices are normalized to frequencies using an algorithm which includes a "<b>pseudocount</b>" (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19106141" class="external text" rel="nofollow">see Nishida 2009</a>).
  The pseudocount is a way to compensate for the effects of small sample
 sizes in the original observations used to generate the profiles.  
Nishida et al. studied how to determine an appropriate value for the 
pseudocount.  They found that the optimal values were independent of the
 sample size and were correlated with the entropy of the original 
matrices.  They say that this implies that the less-conserved the 
binding site, the larger a value should be used for the pseudocount.  
They find that 0.8 is a good value "for practical uses".  They do not 
recommend use of the square root of the total count.
</p><p>geWorkbench allows a pseudocount factor to be directly entered, 
or it can be selected to be the square root of the total count of 
sequences used to generate the profile.  Prior to geWorkbench 1.8.0, 
setting the pseudocount to the square root of the total counts was 
directly coded and not changeable.  The current default is to set the 
pseudocount equal to 1.0.
</p><p>The normalization forumula used in calculating frequencies is 
then, where b is the pseudocount, and counts(i, j) is the observed count
 in a particular entry in the matrix,
</p><p>freq(i, j) = (counts(i, j) + b/4) / (totalCounts + b).
</p><p><br>
The resulting frequency matrix is used in the subsequent scan.
</p><p>Because the pseudocount is a settable parameter, the frequency matrix is recalculated for each scan from the original counts.

<p>The Promoter component is only available when a sequence has been 
loaded, either from disk or for example using the Sequence Retriever 
component to obtain genomic sequence.
</p><p>For this example, we will obtain upstream genomic sequence for 
CDH2, the N-Cadherin gene.  However, using the Sequence Retriever 
component requires that a microarray dataset and its annotations be 
loaded.  Here, we will use the JB-ccmp_0120.txt file, which is an 
Affymetrix HG-U95Av2 MAS5 format text file and is part of the 
geWorkbench <a href="http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/workbench/index.php/Download#Tutorial_data" class="external text" rel="nofollow">tutorial dataset</a>.  
</p><p>The Affymetrix HG-U95Av2 annotation file can be obtain from the Affymetrix website.

</p><p>1. In the Project Folders component, load the file JB-ccmp_0120.txt as type  MAS5/GCOS.
</p><p>2. When prompted, associate the HG-U95Av2 annotation file.  
</p><p>3. In the Markers component, search for the gene name "CDH2" using the <b>Find Next</b> button.  On this chip type, marker 2053_at represents the CDH2 gene.  
</p><p>4. You can double-click on the marker to add it to the default 
"Selection" set.  Or you can right-click on it and add it to a named 
set, such as "Cadherins".  This is depicted below.
</p><p>5. "Activate" (check the box next to) the set to which you added the marker.
