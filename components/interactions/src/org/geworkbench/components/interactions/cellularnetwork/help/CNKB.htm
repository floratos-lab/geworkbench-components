      <h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This material describes the graphical interface and functionality of 
the CNKB component released with geWorkbench 2.0.0.  This component has 
been extensively enhanced from the version available in geWorkbench 1.8 
and earlier.
</p>
<a name="General"></a><h2>General</h2>
<p>The Cellular Network Knowledge Base (CNKB) is a repository of 
molecular interactions, including those both computationally and 
experimentally derived.  Sources for interactions include both publicly 
available databases such as BioGRID and HPRD, as well as 
reverse-engineered cellular regulatory interactomes developed in the lab
 of Dr. Andrea Califano at Columbia University.
</p><p>Each pairwise interaction may have an associated confidence 
indicator (a value between 0 and 1) reflecting the strength of the 
underlying data, whether experimental or computational.   Details on the
 methodology used to construct the CNKB are available in <a 
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18277385" class="external text"
 title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18277385" rel="nofollow">Mani
 et al. 2008</a>. 
</p><p>Gene interaction information from the CNKB can be used, for 
example, in order to assess the plausibility of a hypothesis of 
concerted molecular action represented by a gene set that has been 
discovered using computational approaches (e.g., by running a clustering
 analysis on a microarray set to identify tandems of co-expressed 
genes). If the genes in such a set are reported in the CNKB to have 
several direct interactions (or several common targets) then this may be
 evidence that the gene set indeed reflects at some level a real 
biological process.
</p><p>The CNKB component allows the user to select a group of markers 
of interest, specify the interaction types  (e.g. Protein-Protein, 
Protein-DNA etc.), and choose a particular interaction data source.  
After a query of the Knowledge Base, results are displayed  both in the 
CNKB component and as interaction graphs in the Cytoscape component.
</p>
<a name="The_CNKB_graphical_interface"></a><h2>The CNKB graphical 
interface</h2>
<p><img

height="611" border="0"
 longdesc="/workbench/index.php/Image:CNKB_with_markers.png">
</p>
<p><br>
The graphical user interface (GUI) of the CNKB component has three areas
 of distinct functionality: The "Activated Marker List", the "Selected 
Marker List", and the "Throttle Graph".  The data source, version, and 
interaction types are specified on a separate "Preferences" tab.
</p><p>The "Activated Marker List" displays markers activated in the <a 
href="http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/workbench/index.php/Data_Subsets_-_Markers"
 title="Data Subsets - Markers">Markers</a> component.  From this list, 
the user can select markers to use in querying the CNKB database.  This 
can be done either by double-clicking on desired markers, or through use
 of a right-click menu (see below); those selected will be added to the 
"Selected Marker List" just below.
</p><p>The "Selected Marker List" displays which markers will be queried
 on, and also displays the query results. 
</p><p>Interactions which will be used to build a network graph can be 
adjusted using the "Throttle Graph".  It is used to set a minimum 
confidence threshold for inclusion in the network.
</p><p>Communication with the CNKB database is initiated by clicking on 
the "Refresh" button and all pairwise interactions in the chosen data 
source that involve any marker in the "Selected Marker List" are 
retrieved. 
</p><p>An interaction network can be constructed by pushing the "Create 
Network" button.  The network will be automatically displayed in the 
Cytoscape component.

</p>
<p><br>
The "Activated Marker List" contains the markers that belong to 
activated marker sets from the Markers component. It contains 3 columns:
</p>
<a name="Marker"></a><h3>Marker</h3>
<p>The marker name (comes from the microarray set node selected in the 
Project Folders area).
</p>
<a name="Gene"></a><h3>Gene</h3> 
<p>The gene name corresponding to the marker, if loaded from an 
annotation file.
</p>
<a name="Type"></a><h3>Type</h3> 
<p>A gene type designation, derived from the gene's GO annotation: 
</p>
<ul><li> <b>TF</b> - Transcription Factor,
</li><li> <b>K</b> - Kinase,
</li><li> <b>P</b> - Phosphatase, and
</li><li> (no entry) - type is unknown.
</li></ul>
<p>Individual markers in the Activated Marker List can be moved to the 
Selected Markers List by double-clicking on them.
</p><p>Alternatively, a right-click menu (shown above) allow a group of 
highlighted markers, or all markers, to be moved to the "Selected 
Markers List".
</p>
<a name="Selected_Marker_List"></a><h2>Selected Marker List</h2>

</p>
<p><br>
Markers which have been moved from the Activated Markers List to the 
Selected Markers List can be used to query the CNKB database. Until a 
query is run, the list items are shown in red and in italics.
</p><p>After a query has been run against the CNKB database, the marker 
entries are shown in regular font, blue letters.

</p>
<p><br>
Items that have been added to the Selected Markers list can be removed 
and sent back to the Activated Markers list by double clicking on their 
entries or through a right-click menu.  The right-click menu (shown 
below) gives the choice of moving only highlighted, or all markers back 
to the Activated Markers list.

</p>
<p><br>
</p><p>The Selected Marker List table contains the following columns:
</p><p><br>
</p>
<a name="Marker_2"></a><h4>Marker</h4>
<p>The marker name (same as in the "Activated Marker List"). Appears 
italicized to indicate that interaction information has not yet been 
retrieved. Bold face font indicates that interaction information has 
been retrieved (and is displayed).
</p>
<a name="Gene_2"></a><h4>Gene</h4> 
<p>The gene name corresponding to the marker, if loaded from an 
annotation file (same as in the "Activated Marker List").

query will be used in creating a network.  It allows, if desired, 
separate control of query and display.
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Restrict to genes present in microarray set</b> - queries to
 the CNKB database may return interaction partners that are not members 
of the microarray dataset from which the original query markers were 
chosen.  Checking this box will cause such markers NOT to be used in 
generating a network graph.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Use setting from column display preferences</b> 
<ul><li> If checked, the same interaction types that have been selected 
in the "Column Display Preferences" control above will be used in

"Selected Interaction Types" list will be used to construct a network 
graph.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<a name="Throttle_Graph"></a><h2>Throttle Graph</h2>
<p>This interactive graph allows users to "throttle" (for the genes in 
the Selected Markers table) which interactions to work with, using as a 
criterion the interactions’ confidence indicator.  As the required 
threshold of likelihood of the interactions is increased, the sum of 
interactions meeting this criterion decreases.

name="Example_-_Creating_an_interaction_network_and_viewing_it_in_Cytoscape"></a><h1>Example
 - Creating an interaction network and viewing it in Cytoscape</h1>
<p>Once the desired set of markers is present and its interaction data 
has been retrieved from the database, an adjacency matrix can be 
computed by clicking the "<b>Create Network</b>" button.  The resulting 
matrix is placed in the Project Folders component under its parent 
microarray dataset.  The adjacency matrix is visualized in the <a 
href="http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/workbench/index.php/Tutorial_-_Cytoscape_Network_Viewer"
 title="Tutorial - Cytoscape Network Viewer"> Cytoscape Viewer</a>.
</p><p>Please note that if the targets retrieved from the Knowledge Base
 include markers/genes not present in the active microarray dataset, 
then whether those markers will be used in creating the network graph in
 Cytoscape is determined by the setting of the "<b>Restrict to genes 
present in microarray set</b>" checkbox under "<b>Network Generation 
Preferences</b>" on the CNKB <b>Preferences</b> tab.
</p><p>The Cytoscape Viewer maintains a list of networks which it has 
currently loaded.  It allows individual loaded networks to be deleted.  
However, the network can be reloaded by clicking on its entry in the 
Project Folders component.  Cytoscape controls are more fully described 
in the <a

<a name="Prerequisites"></a><h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul><li> This example uses the Bcell-100.exp dataset available in the 
data/public_data directory of geWorkbench, and further described on the <a
 href="http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/workbench/index.php/Download" 
title="Download">Download</a> page.  Briefly, this dataset is composed 
of 100 Affymetrix HG-U95Av2 arrays on which various B-cell lines, both 
normal and cancerous, were analyzed.  Thus it explores a potentially 
wide variety of expression phenotypes. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Obtain the annotation file for the HG-U95Av2 array type from 
the Affymetrix NetAffx website (<a 
href="http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx" class="external 
free" title="http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx" 
rel="nofollow">http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx</a>). The 
name will be similar to "HG_U95Av2.na30.annot.csv", where "na30" is the 
version number. Loading the annotation file associates gene names and 
Gene Ontology information with the Affymetrix probeset IDs (see the 
geWorkbench FAQ for details on obtaining these files).
</li></ul>
<a name="Loading_the_example_data"></a><h2>Loading the example data</h2>
<ol><li> Load the Bcell-100.exp dataset into geWorkbench as type 
"Affymetrix File Matrix".  (See <a 
href="http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/workbench/index.php/Tutorial_-_Local_Data_Files"
 title="Tutorial - Local Data Files"> Local Data Files</a>).
</li><li> When prompted, load the annotation file.
</li><li> Create and activate a set of markers in the Markers component.
  For this example, save the file <a 
href="http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/workbench/images/f/fa/GBM_MR_Markers.csv"
 class="internal" title="GBM MR Markers.csv"> GBM_MR_Markers</a> to disk
 and then load it directly into the Markers component by pushing its "<b>Load
 Set</b>" button and browsing to the file located in the geWorkbench 
directory data/public_data.
</li></ol>

When the set is activated by checking the box to the left of its name, 
the transcription factor markers will appear in the "Activate Markers" 
list in the CNKB component.

the query in the CNKB component</h2>
<p>(The steps shown below are also depicted in the screenshots for the 
individual control descriptions above).
</p><p>1.  On the CNKB Main tab, right-clicking on the "Activated 
Markers" list will bring up a menu which allows one to move all 
activated markers or just the highlighted markers to the "Selected 
Markers List" for querying.  
</p><p>2. Select the desired data source and interaction types in the 
CNKB <b>Preferences</b> tab.
</p><p>3.  Now hit the "<b>Refresh</b>" button to perform the query 
against the Cellular Networks Knowledge Base database. 
</p><p>4. Adjust the Throttle Graph allows to set a minimum confidence 
requirement on interactions that will be used to create a network. In 
the example images above, a value of 0.22 was used.
</p><p>5. Hit the "<b>Create Network</b>" button.
</p><p>6. The resulting adjacency matrix is displayed in the <b>Cytoscape</b>
 component.
