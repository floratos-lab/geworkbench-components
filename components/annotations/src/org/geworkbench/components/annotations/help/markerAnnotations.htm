<p>The Marker Annotations component enables the retrieval of biological 
annotation information for a collection of genes. For every gene, the 
following data can be retrieved:
</p>
<ul><li> Links to gene detail pages.
</li><li> A set of pathways containing the gene. 
</li><li> A set of gene-disease and gene-compound associations derived from the literature articles.
</li></ul>
<p>All annotations are retrieved from remote servers maintained by the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) using Cancer Bioinformatics 
Infrastructure Objects (caBIO) services. The data come from the 
following sources:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Pathways</b>: NCI's Pathway Interaction Database (PID). PID pathways come from 3 sources: <a href="http://www.biocarta.com/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">BioCarta</a>, Reactome and "NCI-Nature Curated". Information about the PID and each of the contributing sources is available at: <a href="http://pid.nci.nih.gov/userguide/database_content.shtml" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://pid.nci.nih.gov/userguide/database_content.shtml</a>. 
</li></ul>
<ul><li> <b>Gene-disease/compound associations</b>: the Cancer Gene 
Index (CGI) data base. The reported associations are extracted from 
article abstracts using a combination of automatic text mining, 
semi-automatic verification, and manual curation. Project details are 
available at: <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/cageneindex/Creation+of+the+Cancer+Gene+Index" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/cageneindex/Creation+of+the+Cancer+Gene+Index</a>.
</li></ul>
<a name="Submit_Query"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Submit_Query">Submit Query</span></h2>
<p>The Marker Annotations module will retrieve information for all 
markers that belong to activated marker sets, or, more precisely, for 
the genes corresponding to those markers:
</p><p><img alt="Select marker sets.png" src="markerAnnotations_files/Select_marker_sets.png" height="394" width="225">
</p><p><br>
</p><p><br>
</p><p>E.g., in the example shown above, information will be retrieved 
about the genes AATF, CD40, STAT3. Checkboxes at the bottom of the 
component's user interface can be used to specify which data source(s) 
to query: CGAP, CGI or both. For CGAP, the associated drop-down can be 
used to designate the target organism for which annotations are 
retrieved: human (the default) or mouse. Clicking the "Retrieve 
Annotations" button initiates the communication with the NCI servers:
</p><p><br>
</p><p><img alt="Data source checkboxes.png" src="markerAnnotations_files/Data_source_checkboxes.png" height="80" width="900">
</p><p><br>
While the information is being retrieved, progress indicators will be 
shown for either CGAP, CGI, or both query types, as appropriate.
</p><p>The following image is taken from a query on STAT3.
</p><p><br>
<img alt="Marker Annotations ProgressBar CGAP and CGI.png" src="markerAnnotations_files/Marker_Annotations_ProgressBar_CGAP_and_CGI.png" height="172" width="381">
</p>
<a name="Pathway_and_Gene_Annotations"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Pathway_and_Gene_Annotations">Pathway and Gene Annotations</span></h2>
<p>The "Annotations" tab presents a summary listing of the annotations retrieved from CGAP:
</p><p><img alt="Marker Annotations CGAP gene.png" src="markerAnnotations_files/Marker_Annotations_CGAP_gene.png" height="357" width="845">
</p><p><br>
The listing contains at least one row for each gene which annotation 
information is available for. If a gene is associated with more than one
 pathways, then one row for every pathway is listed (e.g., as is the 
case above for CD40 and STAT3). Every row displays the marker (i.e., 
probeset) id, the corresponding gene name and the name of the associated
 pathway. 
</p><p>Right-clicking on a gene name shows the following menu options.  
Each will link to the named data source to display gene information in 
your browser:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Go to Entrez for <i>gene name</i></b>
</li><li> <b>Go to CGAP for <i>gene name</i></b>
</li><li> <b>Go to GeneCards for <i>gene name</i></b>
</li></ul>
<p><br>
Clicking on a pathway brings up a popup menu offering a number options:
</p><p><br>
<img alt="Marker Annotations CGAP pathway.png" src="markerAnnotations_files/Marker_Annotations_CGAP_pathway.png" height="357" width="847">]
</p><p><br>
</p>
<ul><li> <b>View Diagram</b>: available only for BioCarta pathways. Such
 pathways are accompanied by images offering a graphical/artistic 
rendition of the pathway. Selecting the "View Diagram" option will 
display this image within the "Pathway" tab. 
</li><li> <b>Add pathway genes to set</b>: extracts the pathway genes 
for which there are associated probes in the microarray set currently 
selected by the user and places all such probes in a new marker set 
within the "Markers" component (by default, the marker set is named 
after the pathway). 
</li><li> <b>Export genes to CSV</b>: creates a new text file containing
 a listing of all pathway genes. The file format (csv = comma separated 
values) is compatible with Microsoft Excel. 
</li></ul>
<p>The export file contains the following columns:
</p>
<ul><li> Marker
</li><li> Gene
</li><li> Entrez GeneId
</li><li> Pathway
</li><li> Entrez URL
</li><li> CGAP URL
</li><li> GeneCards URL
</li></ul>
<p><br>
</p><p><img alt="Biocarta.png" src="markerAnnotations_files/Biocarta.png" height="400" width="541">
</p><p><br>
A BioCarta pathway image is displayed above after selecting the "View 
Diagram" option from the "Annotations" tab. The drop-down box, on the 
top left corner above the diagram, shows the name of the currently 
displayed diagram. The component keeps a history of all BioCarta 
diagrams selected by the user; using the drop-down it is possible to 
switch among the corresponding pathway images. The "Clear Diagram" 
button clears the currently displayed diagram. The "Clear History" 
button both clears the currently displayed diagram and removes all 
pathway history information from the pathway name drop-down box.

<a name="Cancer_Gene_Index"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Cancer_Gene_Index">Cancer Gene Index</span></h2>
<p>For many genes, there are hundreds of records in the CGI database. 
Retrieving all those records at once can be a very time consuming 
operation, especially if the query involves many genes. To avoid very 
long waits, the retrieval of the data occurs in 2 stages. In the first 
stage, at most 10 records for each association type 
(gene-disease/gene-compound) are being fetched (for each query gene). 
Data retrieved as displayed in the CancerGeneIndex tab.
</p><p>Note that cells that appear empty (...) may have information when
 expanded.  These "hidden" entries will appear in the filtering controls
 above them, even when "collapsed".
</p><p><br>
<img alt="CGI summary page.png" src="markerAnnotations_files/CGI_summary_page.png" height="285" width="1034">
</p><p><br>
The user interface is divided in two regions, sharing the same overall 
structure and functionality: the table on the left displays gene-disease
 associations, while the table on the right is used for reporting 
gene-compound associations. To avoid redundancy, the paragraphs that 
follow describe only the gene-disease table. The exact same description 
applies in the case of the gene-compound table.
</p><p>Each table row represent an association between a query gene and a
 disease. The first column contains the name of the probeset associated 
with the query gene. For any given gene, if its corresponding probeset 
name appears in bold-face, this means that there are more gene-disease 
records on the CGI server that have yet to be fetched (beyond the 10 
records acquired in the initial retrieval stage). The disease name 
within a row is followed by a number in parentheses. This number 
indicates how many records (among those fetched) support the reported 
association. E.g, in the image above, the first row indicates that there
 are 6 distinct records linking STAT3 to melanoma. A detailed listing of
 these 6 records is available by "expanding" the row. This can be 
achieved by right-clicking on the row and selecting "expand" from the 
ensuing popup menu:
</p><p><br>
<img alt="CGI expanded.png" src="markerAnnotations_files/CGI_expanded.png" height="338" width="843">
</p><p><br>
Each detailed record contains 3 additional pieces of information:
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Role</b>: a curator-assigned description of the kind of 
association being reported. The values in this column come from a 
controlled vocabulary (developed to support the CGI database creation 
effort). 
</li><li> <b>Sentence</b>: the actual article abstract sentence used to 
derive the reported gene-disease association. The full sentence is 
displayed in the text area at the bottom portion of the interface (it is
 also available as a tool tip text, by mousing over the "Sentence" 
column). 
</li><li> <b>Pubmed</b>: the Pubmed ID of the source article. Clicking 
on the Pubmed link brings up in the web browser the corresponding Pubmed
 abstract page (in this example, the sentence used for deriving the 
gene-disease association is actually the paper title): 
</li></ul>
<p><br>
<img alt="Pubmed.png" src="markerAnnotations_files/Pubmed.png" height="453" width="603">
</p><p><br>
</p><p>It is also possible to link out to the NCI thesaurus in order to 
see the definition of the disease being associated with a gene; this is 
achieved by right-clicking on the table row for the gene-disease 
association and selecting the "Link to NCI_Thesaurus" option from the 
popup:
</p><p><img alt="NCI thesaurus disease small.png" src="markerAnnotations_files/NCI_thesaurus_disease_small.png" height="318" width="810">
</p><p><br>
</p><p>It should also be noted that the user interface allows ordering 
and filtering of the data (the latter can be very useful if there are 
many records being displayed):
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Ordering</b>: the table rows can be sorted alphabetically by the contents of any column, by clicking on a column heading. 
</li><li> <b>Filtering</b>: the drop down boxes that appear above the 
columns "Marker", "Gene", "Disease", and "Role" contain one value for 
each distinct entry within those columns. They can be used to select 
only records that contain the designated values. Of note is the 
drop-down associated with the "Disease" column: 
</li></ul>
<p><img alt="CGI disease dropdown.png" src="markerAnnotations_files/CGI_disease_dropdown.png" height="279" width="843">
</p><p><br>
</p><p>The parentheses next to a disease name indicate how many distinct
 genes (among those included in the user query) are associated with this
 particular disease. 
</p><p>It should be noted that these numbers are calculated using only 
fetched records. As mentioned above, the first stage of the information 
retrieval will fetch at most 10 records per gene. The remaining records 
associated with a gene can be retrieved from the CGI server by 
right-clicking on a table row corresponding to the gene and by selecting
 the popup menu option "retrieve" all. After all gene-disease 
association records for a given gene have been fetched, the bold-face 
type of its associated probeset name is removed:
</p><p><img alt="CGI all retrieved.png" src="markerAnnotations_files/CGI_all_retrieved.png" height="383" width="936">
</p><p><br>
Finally, by clicking on the "Export" button at the bottom of the user 
interface, the contents of the gene-disease and the gene-compound tables
 displayed within the CancerGeneIndex tab can be exported as comma 
separated values text files for further analysis or/and visualization by
 spreadsheet software.
